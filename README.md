# STALKER XTREME

This is my modded configuration of **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly** - a *free*, *standalone* mod in the **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** game series. This configuration features **G.A.M.M.A.** (*Grok's Automated Modular Modpack for Anomaly*), which is currently the largest and most popular modpack for **Anomaly**.

***JOIN THE S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. DISCORD SERVER:*** *https://discord.gg/stalker-gamma*

**MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION THOUROUGHLY** - if you don't, you may not achieve the expected results, or the game might not run properly altogether.

Good luck with this **hardcore** setup - it features a *Cold System*, a *Stressful Zone* mod that affects your *psy health*, individual *limb health*, complex (yet comprehensive) *item repairs*, and **much**, much more.

I hope you have fun with this - this took a while to make, so I'd appreciate some support or feedback where possible. If you have any problems, you can contact me for help and I'll do what I can to assist you. You can contact me via Discord Direct Messages at *AwesomedudeX*.

# Required/Recommended PC Specs

Note: Required specs are necessary for the game to be remotely playable with all the default mods, whereas recommended specs will run a up to **30FPS** in most areas, and will achieve up to **60-70FPS** in less demanding areas, like the *Truck Cemetery*, or up to **100-120FPS** in the *Fake Start* testing zone, which can be accessed by pressing **F2** from the main menu.

**Storage**: 200/250GB or more

**RAM**: 8GB DDR4/16GB DDR5 or more

**VRAM**: 4GB GDDR5/6GB GDDR6 or more

**CPU**: Intel Core i5-10400F/Intel Core i7-11800H or better

**GPU**: GTX 1650/RTX 3060 or better

To download and set up my configuration, you will need to download the necessary files for the installation. The process is fairly easy, though there is one (very) time consuming step in the process. All installation instructions are in the ***instructions.txt*** file, inside of the ***Settings Presets*** file. The files you will need are below. If you want the regular ***mods.7z*** file - which has all the mods already installed - instead of the ***modsOptimized.7z*** file - which has a lot of G.A.M.M.A. mods removed to optimize file size (and therefore requires use of the launcher to install the remaining files, which can take a while), then you can send me a message on Discord and I'll get you the file when possible.

To start, create a folder called "STALKER", and open it. Once inside, create a folder called "Anomaly". This will store all of the base game files, and is playable on its own, but tends to be much more enjoyable with mods.

# Installation Files:

## Anomaly Files:

Before you start, you will need STALKER Anomaly 1.5.2; to get it, just download these two files:

***STALKER Anomaly 1.5.1***: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/downloads/stalker-anomaly-151

***STALKER ANOMALY 1.5.2 Update***: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/downloads/stalker-anomaly-151-to-152

AFter they're done downloading, open them in 7zip (download at https://7-zip.org/download.html), and drag and drop **ALL** of the contents of the Anomaly 1.5.1 file into your Anomaly folder. After that's done, do the same for the 1.5.2 update and replace the existing files when prompted. After the game has been installed, run the Anomaly launcher, enable the "Delete shader cache" box, select your display settings and launch the game. Once the main menu loads, close the game - this is just to have STALKER Anomaly generate the folders and files neccessary to mod the game and run it.

You'll also need the latest Demonized Modded Exes so that you can run the mods in this modpack. To get it, go to this link:

***Demonized Modded Exes***: https://github.com/themrdemonized/STALKER-Anomaly-modded-exes

Once on the page, click on the latest release file under **Releases** on the right side of the page, and once on the next page, click on the STALKER-Anomaly-modded-exes file to download it. After that, open it up in 7Zip and drag and drop **everything** in it to the Anomaly folder, and replace the files when prompted.
